1. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00400.pdf --> an introductory outline to different models used
we compare and propose algorithms to predict the sentiment of individual sentences in financial news.
Step 1: perform several preprocessing operations using tools from natural language processing.
Step 2: textual datais mapped to a vector-based representation using sentence embeddings.
Step 3: combine the vector representations with the historic stock market returns of companies to train a sentence-level classifier using multi-instance learning.

2. https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1812/1812.04199.pdf --> Dictionary based approach but can be useful while writing technical paper
In this paper, we retrieved, extracted and analyzed the effects of news sentiments on stocks in the pharmaceutical sector
There are many microeconomic and macroeconomic variables that can lead to the movement of price in the stock market 
identify important words and their polarity in the news articles.
news source: used  moneycontrol.com and Investing.com was used as the source for retrieving detailed intraday (30-minute gap) pricing data for each stock. 

3. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11008.pdf --> associative rule mining approach using performance indicators
The performance indicator words are categorized as lagging and leading indicators. 
Lagging indicators reflect the results of firms activity e.g. improvement or decline in sales, market share, operating profit, operating cost, orders, inventory turns etc. 
The leading indicators signal future events and are precursors to the firms future performance. 
Some of the common examples of leading indicators are: #newstores, #employee recruitments, #employee reductions/layoffs, #new customers,% increase in productivity, % increase in production capacity, #new contracts wonor awarded, and % increase in plant utilization

4. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06173.pdf --> most relevant paper
Bidirectional-LSTM areused to encode the news text and capture the context information, self attention mechanism are applied to distribute attention on most relative words, news and days
The model input are financial news titles extractedfrom Reuters and Bloomberg.
Train our own word embedding with financial domainnews text consisting of news articles from Reuters an Bloomberg.
word embedding + character embedding
Self attention layer: word level + news level
Including the body text of the news performs worse than just the headline, there may be useful information to extract from thebody text
other directions include looking at predicting price movements at arange of time horizons, in order to gauge empirically how quickly informationare absorbed in the market, and relate this to the finance literature on the topic.

5. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.05440.pdf --> sentiment attitude (positive or negative) + sentiment emotion (joy, fear, anger, sadness, trust, disgust, anticipation, surprise)
source code: https://github.com/AndMu/Market-Wisdom
sentiment Data: collected three Financial Times (FT) datasets covering different time periods + large set of historical newsheadlines from Redditâ€™s WorldNews Channel (RWNC) +  gathered from Twitter a large collection of financial tweets 
stock prices data: Quandl, Kaggel, and Bloomberg.
Method: Granger-causality - time series data-driven method for identifying causality based on a statistical hypothesis test that determines whether one time series is instrumental in forecasting the other. (widely accepted in econometrics)

6. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.02709.pdf --> Extracting opinion for aspect based sentiment analysis
 Input to LSTM network is a concatenation of word embedding and feature embeddings ( POS Tagging and phrase chunks)
 for extracting phrases - used rules in english language revolving around nouns, verb, adverb and adjective (heuristic rules)
 pre-processing: remove words occuring once, replace numbers with NUM and all text is lowercase
 word embedding: Senna
 model: Attention based Bi-LSTM + Conditional Random Field (CRF) model is incorporated in the final layer
